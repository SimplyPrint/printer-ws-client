## Usage

TBD.

## TODO

- [ ] Add usage documentation
- [ ] Add examples
- [ ] Add tests for event system and reactivity
- [ ] Unify event bus api with printer events.
- [ ] Move away from `ClientCli` and integrate with `click` directly
- [ ] Expand client to a plugin/module based system
- [ ] Update config backend (Only pydantic)
- [ ] Provide nicer interface for sending especially job_info (e.i. job management logic) so we can bundle important
  steps together for consistency.
